# Project DSX

An economy bot for Discord

## Overview

Project DSX (short for Discord Stock Exchange) is a project to create a powerful user-driven economy bot for Discord. The concept of a user-driven economy bot for Discord is not a new one- Bcoins has a similar feature- however, the principle of DSX is intended to be an expansion upon Bcoin's system, by implementing more user-driven elements, most notably user-owned companies, and hopefully property at some point in the future.
