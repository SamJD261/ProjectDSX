# Project DSX

An economy bot for Discord

## Overview

Project DSX (short for Discord Stock Exchange) is a project to create a powerful user-driven economy bot for Discord. The concept of a user-driven economy bot for Discord is not a new one- Bcoins has a similar feature- however, the principle of DSX is intended to be an expansion upon Bcoin's system, by implementing more user-driven elements, most notably user-owned companies, and hopefully property at some point in the future.

## Repository information

This repository will serve exclusively as a platform to share the development files of DSX, and potentially collaborate with other developers to solve any issues with said dev files. The source code and files used by the Discord bot itself will not be uploaded here, as that would be a hazard to the security of the bot's API, as well as the data that the bot relies on, which could pose a risk to user security if such data is stored on a public repository. That being said, any developers willing to collaborate with me on development are more than welcome to do so, so please let me know if you are interested in helping.
